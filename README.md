# Quickeebooks

Integration with Quickbooks Online via the Intuit Data Services REST API.

This library communicates with the Quickbooks Data Services `v2` API, documented at:

[Data Services v2](https://ipp.developer.intuit.com/0010_Intuit_Partner_Platform/0050_Data_Services)

When Intuit finalizes the `v3` API I would like to move to that version as it appears to be better structured
and has `JSON` request/response formats, which should be easier to work with than XML.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ruckus/quickeebooks.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ruckus/quickeebooks)

## Requirements

This is being developed on Ruby REE, 1.9.2 & 1.9.3. Other versions/VMs are untested but stable Rubies should work in theory.

## Dependencies

Gems:

* `oauth`
* `roxml` : Workhorse for (de)serializing objects between Ruby & XML
* `nokogiri` : XML parsing
* `active_model` : For validations

## Getting Started & Initiating Authentication Flow with Intuit

What follows is an example using Rails but the principles can be adapted to any other framework / pure Ruby.

Create a Rails initializer with:

```ruby
QB_KEY = "your apps Intuit App Key"
QB_SECRET = "your apps Intuit Secret Key"

$qb_oauth_consumer = OAuth::Consumer.new(QB_KEY, QB_SECRET, {
    :site                 => "https://oauth.intuit.com",
    :request_token_path   => "/oauth/v1/get_request_token",
    :authorize_url        => "https://appcenter.intuit.com/Connect/Begin",
    :access_token_path    => "/oauth/v1/get_access_token"
})
```

To start the authentication flow with Intuit you include the Intuit Javascript and on a page of your choosing you present the "Connect to Quickbooks" button by including this XHTML:


```HTML
<!-- somewhere in your document include the Javascript -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://appcenter.intuit.com/Content/IA/intuit.ipp.anywhere.js"></script>

<!-- configure the Intuit object: 'grantUrl' is a URL in your application which kicks off the flow, see below -->
<script>
intuit.ipp.anywhere.setup({menuProxy: '/path/to/blue-dot', grantUrl: '/path/to/your-flow-start'});
</script>

<!-- this will display a button that the user clicks to start the flow -->
<ipp:connectToIntuit></ipp:connectToIntuit>
```

Your Controller action (the `grantUrl` above) should look like this:

```ruby
  def authenticate
    callback = quickbooks_oauth_callback_url
    token = $qb_oauth_consumer.get_request_token(:oauth_callback => callback)
    session[:qb_request_token] = token
    redirect_to("https://appcenter.intuit.com/Connect/Begin?oauth_token=#{token.token}") and return
  end
```

Where `quickbooks_oauth_callback_url` is the absolute URL of your application that Intuit should send the user when authentication succeeeds. That action should look like:

```ruby
def oauth_callback
	at = session[:qb_request_token].get_access_token(:oauth_verifier => params[:oauth_verifier])
	token = at.token
	secret = at.secret
	realm_id = params['realmId']
	# store the token, secret & RealmID somewhere for this user, you will need all 3 to work with Quickeebooks
end
```

## Creating an OAuth Access Token

Once you have your users OAuth Token & Secret you can initialize your `OAuth Consumer` and create a `OAuth Client` using the `$qb_oauth_consumer` you created earlier in your Rails initializer:

```ruby
oauth_client = OAuth::AccessToken.new($qb_oauth_consumer, access_token, access_secret)
```

## Quickbooks Online vs Windows

IDS provides 2 APIs, one for interacting with Quickbooks Online resources and one for Quickbooks Windows resources.

See: https://ipp.developer.intuit.com/0010_Intuit_Partner_Platform/0050_Data_Services

You will need to be aware of which flavor of the API you want to invoke.

For example:

```ruby
# Instantiate a Online API
customer_service = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer.new
customer_service.access_token = oauth_client
customer_service.realm_id = realm_id
customer_service.list

# Instantiate a Windows API
customer_service = Quickeebooks::Windows::Service::Customer.new(oauth_client, realm_id)
customer_service.access_token = oauth_client
customer_service.realm_id = realm_id
customer_service.list
```

All of the documentation below is geared towards the Online flavor but unless noted one should be able to replace it with Windows.

Now we can initialize any of the `Service` clients:

```ruby
customer_service = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer.new
customer_service.access_token = oauth_client
customer_service.realm_id = realm_id
customer_service.list
customer_service.list

# returns a `Collection` object
```

See *Retrieving Objects* for the complete docs on fetching collections.

Quickbooks API requires that all HTTP operations are performed against a client-specific "Base URL", as discussed here:

Note: The Windows and Online(versions 7.0 and above) now use a static base URL which is the default URL that is used with Quickeebooks so no additional HTTP requests are made.

[Getting the Base URL](https://ipp.developer.intuit.com/0010_Intuit_Partner_Platform/0050_Data_Services/0400_QuickBooks_Online/0100_Calling_Data_Services/0010_Getting_the_Base_URL)

Quickeebooks will attempt to determine the base URL for the given OAuth client and Realm. This comes at the cost of the overhead of making that initial request. A customers Base URL should not change so if you know it ahead of time then you can specify it as the third argument to the service constructor. For example:

```ruby
customer_service = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer.new(oauth_client, realm_id, "https://qbo.intuit.com/qbo36")
```

## Retrieving Objects

Use a `Service` sub-class to fetch objects of that resource and specifically use the `list` method.

The signature of the `list` method is:

```ruby
list(filters = [], page = 1, per_page = 20, sort = nil, options = {})
```

Where `filters` is an array of `Filter` objects (see below). Pagination is set to page 1 and 20 results per page by default.
Pass a `Sort` object for any desired sorting or just let Intuit use the default sorting for that resource (see below for more sorting options).

Specify none of these to get the defaults:

```ruby
customer_service = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer.new
customer_service.access_token = oauth_client
customer_service.realm_id = realm_id
customer_service.list

# fetch all customers with default parameters (pagination, sorting, filtering)
customers = customer_service.list
```

Return result: a `Collection` instance with properties: `entries`, `current_page`, `count` which should be self-explanatory.

### Filtering (full Online API support, partial Windows API support)

For Online, all filters in the Intuit documentation are supported: text, datetime, boolean.

For Windows, Intuit has a custom API for certain query fields: you cannot search on an arbitrary attributes. See https://ipp.developer.intuit.com/0010_Intuit_Partner_Platform/0050_Data_Services/0500_QuickBooks_Windows/0100_Calling_Data_Services/0015_Retrieving_Objects#Filtering for more information, and to see which attributes are queryable, see: https://ipp.developer.intuit.com/0010_Intuit_Partner_Platform/0050_Data_Services/0500_QuickBooks_Windows/0600_Object_Reference/Invoice#section_9

Note: you'll get an exception from Intuit if you attempt to query on a non-queryable attribute.

Construct an instance of `Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::Filter` with the type of filter, one of: `:text`, `:datetime`, `:boolean`.

Pass an array of `Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::Filter` objects as the first argument to the Services `list` method and all filters will be applied.

#### Filtering on a text field

Specify a type of `:text` and your desired `:field` and a `:value` clause which will enforce an exact match.

Note: the Intuit API is case-INSENSITIVE.

```ruby
Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::Filter.new(:text, :field => 'FamilyName', :value => 'Richards')
```

#### Filtering on a Date/Time

Specify a type of `:datetime` and your desired `:field` than any combination of: `:before` and `:after`

Examples:

```ruby
# find all customers created after 2/15/2011
datetime = Time.mktime(2011, 2, 15)
Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::Filter.new(:datetime, :field => 'CreateTime', :after => datetime)

# find all customers created before 3/28/2011
datetime = Time.mktime(2011, 2, 28)
Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::Filter.new(:datetime, :field => 'CreateTime', :before => datetime)

# find all customers created between 1/1/2011 and 2/15/2011
after = Time.mktime(2011, 1, 1)
before = Time.mktime(2011, 2, 15
Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::Filter.new(:datetime, :field => 'CreateTime', :after => after, :before => before)
```

#### Filtering on a Boolean field

Specify a type of `:boolean` and your desired `:field` and a `:value` with either `true` or `false`

```ruby
# find all customers and exclude jobs
Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::Filter.new(:boolean, :field => 'IncludeJobs', :value => false)
```

#### Filtering on a Number

Specify a type of `:number` and an operator, one of: `:gt`, `:lt`, or `:eq`.

```ruby
# find all customers and exclude jobs
Quickeebooks::Shared::Service::Filter.new(:number, :field => 'Amount', :gt => 150)
```

Once you have created all of your `Filters` than just pass an array of them to any services `list` method and they will all be applied.

Example: find all Customers with a last name of 'Richards' who have been created before Feb 25, 2012:

```ruby
filters = []
filters << Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Filter.new(:text, :field => 'FamilyName', :value => 'Richards')
datetime = Time.mktime(2011, 2, 25)
filters << Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Filter.new(:datetime, :field => 'CreateTime', :before => datetime)
customer_service = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer.new
customer_service.access_token = oauth_client
customer_service.realm_id = realm_id
customer_service.list

customers = customer_service.list(filters)
```
## Sorting (currently only supported in the Online API)

Create an instance of `Quickeebooks::Service::Sort` where the first argument is the field and the second is the sorting direction/logic.

See [Sorting and Pagination](https://ipp.developer.intuit.com/0010_Intuit_Partner_Platform/0050_Data_Services/0400_QuickBooks_Online/0100_Calling_Data_Services/0030_Retrieving_Objects#Sorting) for the complete set of sorting options.

Example

```ruby
sorter = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Sort.new('FamilyName', 'AtoZ')
```

## Bringing it all together

Goal: fetch all customers with a last name of Smith starting at the first page with a per page size of 30, created between May and August of 2011 and sort by last name from A-to-Z.

```ruby
filters = []
filters << Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Filter.new(:text, :field => 'FamilyName', :value => 'Smith')

d1 = Time.mktime(2011, 5, 1)
d2 = Time.mktime(2011, 8, 1)
filters << Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Filter.new(:datetime, :field => 'CreateTime', :after => d1, :before => d2)

sorter = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Sort.new('FamilyName', 'AtoZ')

customer_service = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer.new
customer_service.access_token = oauth_client
customer_service.realm_id = realm_id
customer_service.list

customers = customer_service.list(filters, 1, 30, sort)

# returns

customers.count
=> 67

customers.current_page
=> 1

customers.entries
=> [ #<Quickeebooks::Online::Model::Customer:0x007f8e29259770>, #<Quickeebooks::Online::Model::Customer:0x0078768202020>, ... ]
```

## Reading a single object

Use the `Service` instance to fetch an object by its id using the `fetch_by_id` method:

```ruby
# fetch the Customer object with an id of 100
customer_service = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer.new
customer_service.access_token = oauth_client
customer_service.realm_id = realm_id
customer_service.list

customer = customer_service.fetch_by_id(100)
customer.name
=> John Doe
```

## Writing Objects

Create or fetch an instance of a `Model` object and pass it to the corresponding service `create` or `update` method.

You will need make sure you supply all required fields for that Intuit object, so consult the documentation. For instance the documentation for a `Customer` object is at: [Intuit Customer Object](https://ipp.developer.intuit.com/0010_Intuit_Partner_Platform/0050_Data_Services/0400_QuickBooks_Online/Customer)

## Creating a single object

Pass an instance of your object to the `create` method on its related Service:

```ruby
customer_service = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer.new
customer_service.access_token = oauth_client
customer_service.realm_id = realm_id
customer_service.list

customer = Quickeebooks::Online::Model::Customer.new
customer.name = "Richard Parker"
customer.email = "richard@example.org"
customer_service.create(customer)
```



## Updating a single object

Pass an instance of your object to the `update` method on its related Service:

```ruby
customer_service = Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer.new
customer_service.access_token = oauth_client
customer_service.realm_id = realm_id
customer_service.list

customer = customer_service.fetch_by_id(100)
customer.name = "Richard Parker"
customer.email = "richard@example.org"
customer_service.update(customer)
```

# Services

All `Service` objects (`Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Customer`, `Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Account`, `Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Invoice`, etc) have a simple API for CRUD operations. Some service objects have additional functionality (for example the Invoice object can fetch a PDF representation of an invoice). See notes below for each service.

```ruby
create(object)
update(object)
list()
fetch_by_id(object_id)
delete(object)
```

Current Services:

* Account
* Customer
* Invoice
* Item


## Invoice Service

The `Quickeebooks::Online::Service::Invoice` has the ability to retrieve an invoice as a PDF document:

```ruby
invoice_as_pdf(invoice_id, destination_file_name)
```

Usage: Download invoice #89 and store it at `/tmp/invoice.pdf`:

```ruby
invoice_as_pdf(89, "/tmp/invoice.pdf")
```
_Note:_ it is up to you the caller to remove or clean up the file when you are done.


## Logging

```ruby
Quickeebooks.log = true
```
